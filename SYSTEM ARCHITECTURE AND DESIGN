A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm
which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and
biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one
from the other. The pre- processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as
compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are
hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these
filters/characteristics.

A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies
in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a
better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters
involved and reusability of weights. In other words, the network can be trained to
understand the sophistication of the image better.

The role of the ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form which is easier to
process, without losing features which are critical for getting a good prediction
