Conclusion:
The main idea behind developing the identification website is to build awareness
regarding bird-watching, bird and their identification, especially birds found in
India. It also caters to the need of simplifying the bird identification process and
thus making bird-watching easier. The technology used in the experimental setup
is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It uses feature extraction for image
recognition. The method used is good enough to extract features and classify
images.
The main purpose of the project is to identify the bird species from an image given as
input by the user. We used CNN because it is suitable for implementing advanced
algorithms and gives good numerical precision accuracy. It is also general-purpose and
scientific. We achieved an accuracy of 85%-90%. We believe this project extends a great
deal of scope as the purpose meets. In wildlife research and monitoring, this concept can
be implemented in-camera traps to maintain the record of wildlife movement in specific
habitat and behaviour of any species.
Enhancements :
1) Create an android/iOS app instead of website which will be more convenient to user.
2) System can be implemented using cloud which can store large amount of data for
comparison and provide high computing power for processing (in case of Neural
Networks).
