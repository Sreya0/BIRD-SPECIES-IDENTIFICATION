In our world, there are above 9000 bird species. Some bird species are being found rarely and if found
also prediction becomes very difficult. In order to overcome this problem, we have an effective and
simple way to recognize these bird species based on their features. Also, the human ability to recognize
the birds through the images is more understandable than audio recognition. So, we have used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNâ€™s are the strong assemblage of machine learning which
have proven efficient in image processing. In this paper, a CNN system classifying bird species is
presented and uses the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 [CUB-200-2011] dataset for training as well as testing
purposes. By establishing this dataset and using the algorithm of similarity comparison, this system is
proved to achieve good results in practice. By using this method, everyone can easily identify the name
of the particular bird which they want to know
